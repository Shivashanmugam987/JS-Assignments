QUESTION 1

console.log(1 + "2" + "2"); - console output : 122

It gives the output of combining the number 1, string 2 and 2, since we hav given "+" and both 2's are in quotes which is a string and gives the result aS 122

console.log(1 + +"2" + "2"); - console output : 32

+ or - operand in front of a string converts it to number. so here +"2" will become 2 hence the result will be 3 and combnines with the string 2 tp give the result 
as 32.

console.log(1 + -"1" + "2"); - console output : 02

+ or - operand in front of a string converts it to number. so here -"1" will become (-1) hence the result will be 1+(-1)=0 and combnines with the string 2 tp give the result 
as 02.

console.log(+"1" + "1" + "2"); - console output : 112

 or - operand in front of a string converts it to number. so here +"1" will become (+)1 and combines with two strings 1 and 2 respectively which gives result as 112

console.log( "A" - "B" + "2"); - NaN2

There is no work for operator - since both A and B are strings and it will kill the memories of those strings, so it gives the result as "NaN"(null) and combines it with the string  2
and gives the result as NaN2

console.log( "A" - "B" + 2); - NaaN(null)

There is no work for operator - since both A and B are strings and it will kill the memories of those strings, so it will becomes null when combining null with the integer or number 2,
it will gives the result as null+2 = NaaN which is also null
