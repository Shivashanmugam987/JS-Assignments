Question 1


Result : undefined

Reason: This will gives the output as undefined that we have declared "clothes.length = 0;" but the actual length of the array is 2.

Html code:

var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    s = 0;
    
for (i = 0; i < array.length; i += 1) 
   {
    s += array[i];
    
    }
